# DatabaseProgrammingFinalProject
Basic Book Share Website

Simple book sharing website that we completely built from scratch. We created our own database to populate the website. Students can create an account, login, upload a book to share with others, and borrow books from others. Admins have standard administrative powers. We do not allow any deletion of books or users, we simply make them inactive so we can keep a history.
